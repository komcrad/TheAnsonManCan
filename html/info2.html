</div>
</div class="row">
	<p class="col-sm-4 text-center">I grew up in a Christian home and attended a private Christian school for all 12 years of my education. I was saved at six years old through my teachers and my parents and have continued to grow in Christ since then. 
I have two brothers, one of which is attending Cedarville this year and is a senior. My other brother is pretty tech-savvy and is pursuing a career in that. I have a fantastic group of friends, who banded together and helped immensely with my campaigning!</p>
	<p class="col-sm-4 text-center">Last year as a senior in high school, I was able to an EMT course as well as a few other classes at a local community college. I really have a desire to help people and thought that working as an EMT would be a great avenue to do that. After becoming nationally certified, I applied and interviewed to become a part of CUEMS for the freshman year and was accepted! So whenever you call '911' on campus, I could be the one who comes and helps you out! 
I also have a love for music. I have been singing since as far back as I can remember. I am a member of the Men's Glee Club at Cedarville this year and am looking forward to how that goes! I also started taking piano lessons when I was 5 years old and have continued to take them ever since. I took 2 years of guitar lessons when I was younger but have since focused on piano. There was also a brief time when I played the drums, but immediately realized that it wasn't for me! (the multitasking is real)</p>
	<p class="col-sm-4 text-center"> I'm running for freshman class president to make the first year at Cedarville the best it can possibly be! I have some great ideas for some events and am very excited to share them with you guys! I love comments and suggestions, so if you have any ideas for anything, feel free to send me an email! Together we're going to make this year AMAZING!</p>
